# Cypress
The files lidar.h and lidar.cpp can be used to communicate with Garmin lidar-light v3 (manual: https://static.garmin.com/pumac/LIDAR_Lite_v3_Operation_Manual_and_Technical_Specifications.pdf) via I2C-interface. There are basic functions for reading and writing from or to a register.
I used the Cypress-evaluationboard CYBLE-214015-01 (https://www.cypress.com/documentation/datasheets/cyble-214015-01-ez-ble-creator-module).

If there are any bugs or suggestions please let me know.
